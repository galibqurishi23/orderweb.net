# Customer Deletion Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issue Identified
Admin panel customer deletion was not working because:

1. **Missing DELETE API Endpoint**: The `/api/admin/customers/[id]/route.ts` endpoint didn't exist
2. **Type Mismatch**: Customer ID was defined as `number` in TypeScript but stored as `string` (UUID) in database
3. **No Transaction Handling**: Need to delete related records in correct order to respect foreign key constraints

## Root Cause
- Frontend was calling `DELETE /api/admin/customers/${customerId}` 
- This endpoint was completely missing from the API routes
- The only existing endpoint was `GET /api/admin/customers/route.ts`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created DELETE API Endpoint
**File**: `/home/opc/orderweb-app/src/app/api/admin/customers/[id]/route.ts`

Features:
- ✅ Uses database transactions for data integrity
- ✅ Validates customer belongs to tenant before deletion
- ✅ Deletes all related records in correct order:
  1. Customer addresses
  2. Customer communications
  3. Customer preferences
  4. Customer reviews
  5. Customer sessions
  6. Password resets
  7. Login attempts
  8. Campaign interactions
  9. Special events
  10. Loyalty transactions
  11. Phone lookup records (loyalty system)
  12. Customer loyalty points
  13. Updates orders (removes customer reference)
  14. Finally deletes customer record

- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with rollback
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Returns success confirmation with deleted customer details

### 2. Fixed TypeScript Types
**File**: `/home/opc/orderweb-app/src/app/[tenant]/admin/customers/page.tsx`

Changes:
```typescript
// Before:
interface Customer {
  id: number;  // ❌ Wrong type
  // ...
}

// After:
interface Customer {
  id: string;  // ✅ Correct - matches UUID in database
  // ...
}
```

Also updated:
- `deletingCustomerId` state from `number | null` to `string | null`
- `deleteCustomer` function parameter from `customerId: number` to `customerId: string`

## Database Schema Consideration

### Current Implementation (Conservative):
Orders are **NOT deleted**, only the customer reference is removed:
```sql
UPDATE orders SET customer_id = NULL WHERE customer_id = ?
```

**Rationale**: 
- Preserves restaurant's order history for accounting/analytics
- Orders remain visible in admin panel
- Customer data is anonymized but order data retained

### Alternative Option (Complete Deletion):
If you want to completely remove all traces including orders, uncomment this section in the DELETE endpoint:
```typescript
// Option B: Complete order deletion
const [orderDeleteResult] = await connection.execute(
  'DELETE FROM orders WHERE customer_id = ?',
  [customerId]
);
```

## Testing

### To Test Customer Deletion:

1. **Login to Admin Panel**: https://orderweb.net/kitchen/admin/customers
2. **View Customer List**: You should see "Galib Qurishi" listed
3. **Click Delete Button**: Red trash icon next to customer
4. **Confirm Deletion**: Accept the confirmation dialog
5. **Verify Success**: Customer should be removed from list
6. **Check Database**: Customer should be completely removed

### Database Verification:
```bash
# Before deletion
sudo mysql -e "USE dinedesk_db; SELECT id, name, email FROM customers WHERE email = 'gqurishi@live.com';"

# After deletion - should return empty
sudo mysql -e "USE dinedesk_db; SELECT id, name, email FROM customers WHERE email = 'gqurishi@live.com';"

# Verify related data is also gone
sudo mysql -e "USE dinedesk_db; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer_loyalty_points WHERE customer_id = '<customer-uuid>';"
```

## Security Features

1. **Tenant Validation**: Ensures customer belongs to requesting tenant
2. **Transaction Safety**: All-or-nothing deletion (rollback on any error)
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Tracks deletion progress for audit trail
4. **Confirmation Dialog**: Prevents accidental deletions

## What Gets Deleted

When a customer is deleted:
- ✅ Customer profile and account information
- ✅ All saved addresses
- ✅ Communication preferences and history
- ✅ Customer preferences and settings
- ✅ Reviews and ratings
- ✅ Active sessions (logs them out)
- ✅ Password reset requests
- ✅ Login attempt history
- ✅ Marketing campaign interactions
- ✅ Special event registrations
- ✅ Loyalty points balance
- ✅ Loyalty transaction history
- ✅ Phone-based loyalty lookup records
- ⚠️ Orders: Customer reference removed but orders kept (configurable)
